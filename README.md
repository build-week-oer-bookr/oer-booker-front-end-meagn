# oer-booker-front-end-meagn

Pitch: OER Bookr is a teacher's source for open educational resources (OER). Picture the Yelp of text books, a social platform for peer reviewed, open licensed text books. 

MVP: As a teacher I can log in, and see a grid of open text books, organized by subject. Each book will have a 5 star rating system. As a user I can review each book. 

Stretch Goal: A link to each book will take me to a site where I can download/access the open textbook.
